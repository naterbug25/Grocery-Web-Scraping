# Grocery-Web-Scraping
Scrap price data on items from Aldi, Kroger, and Walmart 

The script records and plots price data from Instacart for Aldi, Kroger, Walmart, and Ruler Foods. 

The "Item_List.csv" file contains each respective item's url for the script to navigate the browser too. 

Requirements: 
Install python 3. 

Install the following with pip: 
1. selenium
2. datetime
3. pandas
4. plotly
5. undetected_chromedriver

Within a python command terminal, run "main.py" to start the script. 

Note: The prices captured are intended to be used as a personal reference and may not be accurate to what your local store's prices are / current sale price. 
Note: The prices are scraped from Instacart, not the store's website.
